# Implementing-Active-Directory-

**Overview**

This project builds on the previously configured SAVN.local virtual network by implementing Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) & Joining a Domain. The EPS-SP24-S22-1 server will be configured as the domain controller, and the other two virtual machines (EPS-SP24-S22-2 & EPS-SP24-W10-1) will be joined to the domain.

**Objectives**

Install and configure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) on EPS-SP24-S22-1.  
Promote the server to a domain controller for SAVN.local.  
Join EPS-SP24-S22-2 and EPS-SP24-W10-1 to the domain.  
Verify domain connectivity and authentication.
